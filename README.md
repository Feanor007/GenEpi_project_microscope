## Abstract 
GenEPi, developed by Pantazis lab, is a genetically encoded fluorescent reporter for the essential mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1. It is a non-invasive, highly specific reporter of Piezo1 function with a high spatiotemporal resolution, making it a useful tool for studying how Piezo1 regulates development, physiology, and disease. In order to treat disorders caused by Piezo1 mutations, it is necessary to screen for modulators of Piezo1 function. However, the high cost of fluorescent screening platforms is limiting further research on Piezo1, especially in developing countries. 
  
The aim of our project was to develop an ultra-cheap fluorescence microscope screening platform to enable easy Piezo1 signal visualization and evaluation. We designed our microscope set up, ordered the relevant parts, designed and 3D printed a CAD skeleton to hold them in place and assembled our design; then we carried out testing and amended our set up. With the assistance of post-experimental image processing, our prototype is suitable for evaluating the change in fluorescent intensity of samples containing GenEPi. Our microscope prototype has an extremely low cost of under 500 pounds whilst still providing adequate quality for Piezo1 signal screening. In conclusion, our screening platform design addresses the unmet need for the low-cost microscope for Piezo1 research. At the same time, it is potentially beneficial for long-term further clinical study based on fluorescence screening.
